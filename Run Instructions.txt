Basically, copy the folder named "server" in the pc that is running XMPlay, and execute "run.py". Write the requested info (listen ip and port), and the server should be running.

Then, in the pc that you want to use as a "remote control", copy the folder named "client", and execute "client.py". Again, write the requested info (server ip and port), and you are done. Then start to type commands!

Note: the server is capable of find the title of the song if, and only if, the title of the window of the player starts with "XMPlay".
XMPlay has an option to do that. If you don't find it, go to the folder where the executable is, and search the file "xmplay.ini". Search this line:
TitleForm=%?2{%2 - }%?1{%1|%0}
and replace only that line with the next one:
TitleForm=XMPlay - %?2{%2 - }%?1{%1|%0}

And then, you are done.
This is because i didn't have other choice to take the name of the song.

Enjoy!

Basically, copy the folder named "server" in the pc that is running XMPlay, and execute "run.py". Write the requested info (listen ip and port), and the server should be running.

Then, in the pc that you want to use as a "remote control", copy the folder named "client", and execute "client.py". Again, write the requested info (server ip and port), and you are done. Then start to type commands!

Enjoy!
